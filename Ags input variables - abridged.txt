filtering and input variables in Ags model notebook, as they appear, in categories


## category: PAR and VPD ##
IPAR 
a series of booleans representing a filtermask for PAR (photosynthetically active radiation)
	based on filter: GPP ==0 and PAR>5
IVPD 
a series of booleans representing a filtermask for VPD (vapor pressure defecit)
	based on filter: VPD>0.1


## category: Precipitation ##
precip 
a series containing halfhourly precipitation data
I0
a series containing filtered halfhourly precipitation data
	based on filter: precip>0 (is this to take out errors?)
II
a series of booleans representing a filtermask for Precipitation
	based on filter: precipitation in current 30 minutes and previous 60 minutes is exactly 0 (total span 90 minutes)


## category: CO2 ##
CO2
a series of booleans representing a filtermask for CO2 concentration,  based on df_profile dataframe
	based on filter: CO2 >300 (ppm?)


## category: filtered dataframes ##
df_meteo_filter
df_Comb_filter
df_profile_filter
df_EC_filter

these are all variations of the dataframes df_meteo, df_Comb, df_profile, df_EC,
but they are each filtered in succession so CO2 >300, Precip(90min) == 0, VPD>0.1, and PAR>5, respectively


## category: GPP ##
GPP_f
a series containing GPP_f, taken from df_Comb_filter (filtered based on: PAR>5), but converted from umolm-2s-1 to mgm-2s-1  (microgram per m2 per s)
